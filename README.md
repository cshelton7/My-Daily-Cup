# Twitter API

To use this API with your own app, you would first have to set up a twitter developer account.
There you will be given your own api_key and secret_key.
You will also need to upgrade your account to "Elevated" which will give you access to the "trends" that we use in our app.
Store the keys somewhere safe where you can retrieve them for your requests to to the twitter API.
